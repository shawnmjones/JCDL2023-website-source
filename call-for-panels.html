            <p>
            Panels at JCDL are intended to draw together communities of interest, including those with strong traditions in the digital library community as well as those involving emerging issues of interest to members of the community at large. The panels typically last about 60 - 90 minutes and include an extended round-table discussion among the selected participants and the audience members. All proposals are welcome to suggest panel formats that will engage and inform the audience and, if accepted, JCDL will work to provide appropriate facilities and setups to enable the panel techniques.  Panels can be comprised of short position statements followed by discussion or can be structured as conversations that engage audience members from the outset. While topics are open, JCDL aims to secure at least one panel relating to this year's theme: Rethinking Digital Records â€“ Exploring new perspectives, challenges, and opportunities for libraries, archives, museums, and galleries.
