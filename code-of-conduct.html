                    <p>The Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL) is dedicated to providing an environment where everyone is welcome. The conference organizers work hard to make all sessions (in-person and online), breaks, and social events a positive experience for everyone. JCDL is proud to welcome participants from all over the world, bringing a wide variety of professional, personal, and social backgrounds to the event. We treat all colleagues with dignity and respect, we all represent the Digital Libraries community. Without exception, JCDL does not tolerate harassment and discrimination in any form.</p>

                    <ul>
                    <li>The JCDL community maintains values such as:</li>
                    <li>Encourages discussions that focus on the work, not the person,</li>
                    <li>Practices active listening and engagement,</li>
                    <li>Gives credit where credit is due,</li>
                    <li>Values openness and transparency, and</li>
                    <li>Strives to express ourselves simply and clearly.</li>

                    <p>JCDL does not tolerate harassment and discrimination in any form. Discrimination and harassment include, but are not limited to:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>offensive verbal comments related to sex, gender, ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, religion;</li>

                        <li>harassing photography or recording;</li>

                    <p>JCDL participants communicate primarily in English. Since English is not everyone’s native language, we strive to express ourselves simply and clearly, remembering that unnecessary use of jargon, acronyms, country-specific terminology, and slang will be a barrier to understanding for many of our colleagues. We are sensitive to the fact that the international nature of the conference means that we span many different social norms around language and behavior and we strive to conduct ourselves in ways that are unlikely to cause offense to others.</p>

                    If you have been involved or witnessed an incident during JCDL (in-person or online) that you believe violates this Code of Conduct, please report this as soon as possible. The easiest way is to email one or more of the Code of Conduct Committee members (see their information below).

                    <p>
                    The JCDL Code of Conduct and Steering Committees will promptly and confidentially examine all incidents reported before, during, and after the conference. We reserve the right to take actions we deem necessary at any time to remedy disruptive behavior that renders the conference experience unsafe for participants. Anyone found to be in violation of this Code of Conduct will be expected to immediately stop harassing or disruptive behavior. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers and Steering Committee representatives (or their designees) may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from the current and/or future JCDL conferences, contacting local authorities as needed, or contacting a representative from the offender's institution.
