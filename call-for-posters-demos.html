                    <p>
                    The organizers of the 2023 ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries are pleased to invite proposals for posters and demonstrations. Posters are intended as a forum for ideas, early-stage explorations, and research outcomes that are well-suited to be presented in a less formal and more interactive manner. Demonstrations are intended to showcase developed innovative digital library technology and applications. Posters and demos relating to the theme of the conference, &quot;Rethinking Digital Records&quot;, are particularly encouraged. 
                    </p>
