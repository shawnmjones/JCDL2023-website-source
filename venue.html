                    The Hilton Santa Fe Historic Plaza has a rich history:

                    <p class="mx-auto p-4">Over three-hundred years ago in 1694, Nicholas Ortiz I arrived in Santa Fe with his wife and six children. By 1776, the first-known map of the Villa de Santa Fe, the Urrutia Map, clearly shows the Ortiz hacienda occupying the entire block where the Hilton of Santa Fe is now located. The Ortiz home surrounded a central corral and eventually included a private chapel, a bakery, stables, and 18 rooms. At the house of Nicolas Ortiz’s son, Antonio Jose Ortiz, plans were laid for “a most solemon function. Santa Fe Fiesta at its inception consisted of three days of secular and religious celebrations, including vespers the first evening, a mass, processions, a sermon, and “government officials in attendance at all events escorted by the royal garrison firing salvos. Fiesta de Santa Fe, has become the oldest community celebration in the country! In 1806, numerous descendants of the Ortiz family continued the Ortiz family traditions of military service, political and religious influence, farming, ranching, and trading. Today, more than three hundred years after the family first arrived in Santa Fe, there is sure to be an Ortiz marching in the procession for La Conquistadora at the Fiesta, which occurs, coincidentally, on the anniversary of the death of Nicholas Ortiz III.<br><br>
                    In 1967, The Santa Fe Historical Society launched a campaign to save the historic houses, with the Ortiz houses being the second oldest residence in Santa Fe. Santa Fe Architect, John Gaw Meem, worked on the project with Hilton Santa Fe to recapture the spirit of the 18th century Ortiz Hacienda. Some of the original adobe bricks were saved for the interior and there are still some bricks around the property that you can see today! Casa Ortiz opened its doors as the Hilton Santa Fe in January of 1973. Hilton Historic Santa Fe Plaza, to this day, still keeps the Ortiz Family Coat of Arms culture and multiple history displays throughout the property! We can’t wait to welcome you to share the great history of the City Different and Hilton Santa Fe!
