                    <p><strong>Data Cartels and the Future of Digital Information Access</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We've probably all observed how digital platforms and products have changed our jobs as library professionals. We spend less time in the stacks and more time learning how to use electronic information platforms and products. Not surprisingly, the companies that provide our library resources are also changing. Traditional publishers and database providers are, more and more, integrating data analytics tools into their library products, and they are also harnessing the power of research-related data to enhance their products. Sarah Lamdan will discuss the transition of publishers to data analytics, and describe how that shift impacts our work.</p>

                    <p><strong>On the way to National Digital Library of Ukraine</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Digitization of objects belonging to the cultural and scientific heritage and creation of digital libraries is used worldwide as a tool to ensure both long-term preservation of digital copies and convenient search and access to them. In many countries, national memory institutions create National Digital Libraries for this purpose.
Since Ukraine's independence in 1992, national, state and university libraries have been digitizing rare and valuable documents and creating digital libraries. However, the percentage of digitized documents is not significant and no national digital library has been created in Ukraine.
Since the outbreak of the Russian war against Ukraine in 2014 and the full-scale aggression on 24 February 2022, cultural and scientific heritage in Ukraine has been in great danger of being destroyed. Many of them have already been destroyed and lost to humanity forever. Therefore, the importance of digitization of cultural and scientific heritage has increased significantly and is of vital importance.
Ukraine is facing these challenges with the help of international institutions such as UNESCO, IFLA and ALIPH, governments, national institutions, private companies from different countries and voluntary initiatives such as SUCHO. The Ukrainian Library Association, as a professional public organization, is leading the way in uniting the efforts of all stakeholders.
On February 14th, the project to create the National Digital Library of Ukraine was announced. The project is coordinated by the Ukrainian Library Association and is implemented under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine with the financial support of UNESCO and in cooperation with IFLA and SUCHO. At the first stage this year we are learning international experience and developing the Concept, Roadmap and Budget of the National Digital Library.   
Since April 2022 we have held the initiative for archiving documents about the Russian-Ukrainian war. More than 40 Ukrainian librarians are archiving documents on the servers of the Portico. Perhaps this collection will also become part of the National Digital Library of Ukraine.

                    <p><strong>How preprints are changing biomedical publishing</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>Publishing in the life sciences is undergoing rapid change. COVID-19 changed researchers' priorities, and recent funder public access mandates are tipping the balance toward open access. These changes are contributing to a larger cultural shift toward acceptance and recognition for preprints. Jessica Polka will discuss how this way of sharing constitutes the foundation of an emerging review and curation ecosystem in the basic biomedical sciences — and the role that institutions and libraries might play in this new environment.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bio:</strong>
As Executive Director of ASAPbio, Jessica leads initiatives related to peer review and oversees the organization’s general administrative and strategic needs.
Jessica performed postdoctoral research in the department of Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School (2013-2016) following a PhD in Biochemistry from UCSF (2012). She lives and works in Somerville, MA.</p>
