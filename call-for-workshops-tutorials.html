            <p>
            The organizers of the 2023 ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries are pleased to invite proposals for workshops and tutorials. Workshops are intended to bring together communities of interest, both in established communities and in communities interested in discussion and exploration of a new or emerging issue. They can range in format from formal, perhaps centering on presentation of refereed papers, to informal, perhaps centering on an extended roundtable discussion among the selected participants. Tutorials provide an opportunity to offer in-depth education on a topic or solution relevant to research or practice in digital libraries. They should address a single topic in detail. They are not intended to be venues for commercial product training. Workshops and tutorials relating to the theme of the conference, "Rethinking Digital Records", are particularly encouraged. Workshops and tutorials can span a half-day or a full day. 
            </p>
