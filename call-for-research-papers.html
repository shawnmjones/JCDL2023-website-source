    <p>
    The notion of what constitutes a digital library has evolved over time. In recent years, the ability to retain a digital record of the volatile world has been of critical importance for ensuring that our collective history is available for posterity. Progressing research and disseminating state-of-the-art advances in digital libraries are thus of supreme importance to humanity.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The annual Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL) is the primary international event for the inter- and multi-disciplinary community of academics and practitioners in digital libraries coming from computer, library, information, and social sciences, and other related disciplines. JCDL encompasses the many meanings of the term digital libraries, including notions of managing, operating, developing, curating, evaluating, or utilizing collections of data/information/knowledge in various domains.

    <h3 id="paper_types" class="scrolltoheader">Paper Types and Formats</h3>

    <p>
    JCDL 2023 offers two paper submission deadlines: Submissions for research papers (long or short) are due on <strike>January 29, 2023</strike> February 5, 2023. The deadline for late-breaking results and datasets is February 12, 2023. The submission formats are outlined below.
    </p>

    <h4>Research Papers (deadline: <strike>January 29, 2023</strike> February 5, 2023)</h4>

    <p>
    Authors may choose between two formats:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li><em>Full papers</em> have at most 10 pages and report on mature work, or efforts that have reached an important milestone. They will get presentation slots of 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
    <li><em>Short papers</em> have at most 4 pages and highlight efforts that might be in an early stage, but are important for the community to be made aware of; they can also present theories or systems that can be described concisely in the limited space. Short papers will get presentation slots of 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Late Breaking Results and Datasets (deadline: <strike>February 12, 2023</strike> February 19,2023)</h4>

    <p>
    This comprises submissions falling into the following categories:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li><em>Late breaking results</em> present new insights or information about research that was completed after the research paper submission deadline.</li>
    <li><em>Dataset submissions</em> are a new category that allow description of relevant research datasets. These need to be either fully publicly available or have to contain a publicly available subset.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Late Breaking Results and Dataset submissions should be 2-4 pages and will be allotted a 5 minute presentation slot at the conference.
    </p>

    <h3 id="submission_guidelines" class="scrolltoheader">Submission Guidelines</h3>

    <p>
    All submissions must be original works, not previously published or under review for publication elsewhere, in English, in PDF format, and in the current ACM two-column conference format. Suitable LaTeX, Word, and Overleaf templates are available from the ACM Website (use "sigconf" proceedings template for LaTeX and the Interim Template for Word, <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" target="_blank">https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>). Complete papers are required; submissions consisting solely of an abstract or those that are otherwise incomplete will not be reviewed. For all formats, references do not count to the page limit. Submissions are to be made via <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jcdl2023" target="_blank">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jcdl2023</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <strong>All submissions will be rigorously peer-reviewed in a double-blind reviewing process.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Submissions must be anonymous</strong> and all references to authors’ works have to be anonymized. We recommend using services like <a href="https://anonymous.4open.science/" target="_blank">https://anonymous.4open.science/</a> to anonymously share code or data. Anonymized works that are available as preprints (e.g., on arXiv or SSRN) may be submitted without citing them. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints, and finding such a preprint does not clash with our submission policies. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    All accepted papers will be included in the proceedings and will be presented at the conference. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for, and present the work at the conference on-site in Santa Fe. In case of traveling restrictions (COVID related or otherwise), an exception may be made to allow authors to present the work remotely.
    </p>
        
    <p>
    <strong>Calls for workshops and tutorials, posters and demos, and panels will be published separately.</strong>
    </p>
