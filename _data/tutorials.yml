  submission:
  duration: Half-Day
  delivery: In-Person, Hybrid Possible
  abstract: This tutorial provides a high-level overview of the rationale of Solid, an introduction to the protocol suite, and the data description approach using linked data. The participants will get a general introduction to the need for decentralization and the rationale of Solid. They will get a hands-on introduction to the capabilities of the Solid protocol. They will learn about the differences with other Linked Data Platform solutions such as Fedora Commons. Demonstrations will be provided on how to protect online resources and a discussion about Solid's potential for open science.

  abstract: "In this 3-hour workshop we will introduce you to ARKs (Archival Resource Keys), which can serve as persistent identifiers, or stable, trusted references for information objects (eg, web addresses that don’t return 404 Page Not Found errors). For more than two decades, 8.2 billion ARKs have been created by over 1000 organizations — libraries, data centers, archives, museums, publishers, government agencies, and vendors. We will cover: <ul><li>Why ARKs &mdash; non-paywalled, decentralized, flexible</li><li>Use cases &mdash; Smithsonian, French National Library, Internet Archive</li></li>Metadata for early and ongoing object development</li><li>How to get started &mdash; one form to fill out</li><li>Minting and assigning ARK identifiers</li><li>Resolvers, resolution, redirection</li><li>Object types &mdash; digital, physical, conceptual</li><li>Persistence considerations</li><li>Available tools</li></ul>"
