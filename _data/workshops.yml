  abstract: The increasingly mature artificial intelligence technologies, such as big data, deep learning, and natural language processing, provide technical support for research on automatic text understanding and bring development opportunities for innovative measurement of scientific communication. Innovation measurement in scientific communication is a challenging and cutting-edge direction in Informetrics. It is interdisciplinary, requiring considering the characteristics of different disciplines and different types of scientific outcomes to establish a comprehensive evaluation metrics system. On the other hand, metadata and content features should be considered to reflect the innovation of scientific works objectively and comprehensively. This workshop focuses on the discussion and produces enlightening outcomes. We will engage broad audiences to share their ideas and pre-productions, enabling an interdisciplinary approach to exploring frontier areas. This workshop consists of keynotes, oral presentations, and poster sessions and would attract interest from academic researchers, librarians, and decision-makers from governments and practical sectors.

  abstract: The 4th Workshop on Extraction and Evaluation of Knowledge Entities from Scientific Documents (EEKE 2023) and the 3rd AI + Informetrics (AII2023) will be held in New Mexico, USA and online at the ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL) 2023. The goal of these two workshop series (<a href="https://eeke-workshop.github.io/">https://eeke-workshop.github.io/</a> and <a href="https://ai-informetrics.github.io/">https://ai-informetrics.github.io/</a>) are to engage the related communities in open problems in the extraction and evaluation of knowledge entities from scientific documents and the modeling and applications of AI + Informetrics for broad interests in science of science, science, technology, & innovation (ST&I), etc. This joint workshop consists of keynotes, oral presentations, and posters, and will attract not only academic researchers and librarians but also decision makers from governments and practical sectors.

  abstract: "2nd International Workshop on Digital Language Archives (LangArc 2023) virtual workshop on digital language archives – digital libraries that preserve, curate, and provide online access to language data – continues (after the initial LangArc 2021 workshop) addressing the growing need. LangArc 2023 will explore a broad scope of issues related to digital language archives. This includes challenges and opportunities, strategies and solutions for: facilitating depositing and improving access; information organization, architecture, and retrieval; quality assurance; usability; ethical issues; ways of encouraging reuse of deposited data in research and education; and coursework and other training for information professionals that will develop and maintain digital language archives. This workshop is expected to support interdisciplinary collaboration among information professionals, linguists, educators, representatives of language communities (including indigenous and other underrepresented), students, and other interested audiences."

  duration: Half-Day
  abstract: "In recent years the US Government has issued two policy guidance memos that will likely have a large impact on academic research. This workshop seeks to walk  through the 2021 National Security Presidential Memo 33 (NSPM-33) ,the 2022 OSTP Public Access Memo and share how use of persistent identifiers (PIDs) are key to ensuring compliance. We’ll share PID aspects of the implementation guidance provided for NSPM-33,  timelines and next steps for the Public Access Memo, and implementation options for both memos. Moving to the technical side, we’ll discuss how the various persistent identifiers function in ensuring trustworthy metadata by from other systems via the API, specifically affiliation metadata (ROR), publication and grant metadata (Crossref) and author and contributing author metadata (ORCID). Finally, we’ll ensure time for interaction and discussion to ensure that research institutions, research administrators, repository managers, are familiar with how their landscape as well as that of funders and publishers will change and how to ensure their community is well-prepared."

  abstract: "Major Research Facilities and large research institutions have complex cyberinfrastructure and workflow needs. There are increasing calls for data openness and sharing, such as with the Nelson memo from last fall, and this is balanced by the complexity to store and manage the this amount of research data. This workshop will facilitate discussion on the problems faced in the research data management of these organizations, and approaches to dealing with these issues through processes, technical tools, or policy."
