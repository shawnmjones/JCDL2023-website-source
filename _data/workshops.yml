  abstract: The increasingly mature artificial intelligence technologies, such as big data, deep learning, and natural language processing, provide technical support for research on automatic text understanding and bring development opportunities for innovative measurement of scientific communication. Innovation measurement in scientific communication is a challenging and cutting-edge direction in Informetrics. It is interdisciplinary, requiring considering the characteristics of different disciplines and different types of scientific outcomes to establish a comprehensive evaluation metrics system. On the other hand, metadata and content features should be considered to reflect the innovation of scientific works objectively and comprehensively. This workshop focuses on the discussion and produces enlightening outcomes. We will engage broad audiences to share their ideas and pre-productions, enabling an interdisciplinary approach to exploring frontier areas. This workshop consists of keynotes, oral presentations, and poster sessions and would attract interest from academic researchers, librarians, and decision-makers from governments and practical sectors.

  abstract: "2nd International Workshop on Digital Language Archives (LangArc 2023) virtual workshop on digital language archives – digital libraries that preserve, curate, and provide online access to language data – continues (after the initial LangArc 2021 workshop) addressing the growing need. LangArc 2023 will explore a broad scope of issues related to digital language archives. This includes challenges and opportunities, strategies and solutions for: facilitating depositing and improving access; information organization, architecture, and retrieval; quality assurance; usability; ethical issues; ways of encouraging reuse of deposited data in research and education; and coursework and other training for information professionals that will develop and maintain digital language archives. This workshop is expected to support interdisciplinary collaboration among information professionals, linguists, educators, representatives of language communities (including indigenous and other underrepresented), students, and other interested audiences."

  abstract: The 2023 edition of the Workshop on Web Archiving and Digital Libraries (WADL) will explore the integration of web archiving and digital libraries. The workshop aims at addressing aspects covering the entire life cycle of digital resources, including such as social media, scholarly and government datasets, 3D objects, and digital online art.creation/authoring, uploading/publishing, crawling, indexing, exploration, and archiving. It will also explore areas such as archiving processes and tools for "non-traditional" resources such as social media, scholarly and government datasets, 3D objects, and digital online art.
